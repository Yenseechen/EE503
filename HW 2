#Coin flip experiment: Use random.uniform() to generate output [Heads, Tail] of a coin flip experiment.
#a) Estimate the probability of heads in a fair coin flip by generating a lot of instances of experiment.
#b) Estimate the probability of heads in a biased coin flip with a bias of 0.8, and find the number of heads and tails in a random experiment.
#c) Plot/Display estimate as a function of number of experiments (n) and argue how do youdecide how many times you need to repeat the experiment to get a good estimate.
